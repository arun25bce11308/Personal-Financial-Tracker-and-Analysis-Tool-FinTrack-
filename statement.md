# Project Statement: Personal Finance Tracker

1. Problem Statement

Many individuals struggle to find a simple, accessible tool to track their daily income and expenses. Using manual methods, like notebooks or spreadsheets, can result in incomplete records and a lack of clarity about spending habits. This leads to a delayed understanding of overall financial health. The main issue is the need for a straightforward and visually appealing desktop application that allows users to track transactions in real time and see a clear graphical representation of their net balance.

2. Scope of the Project

The Finance Tracker is a standalone desktop application created with Python.

In-Scope: Transaction logging (Income/Expense), real-time net balance calculation, and graphical data visualization (Pie Chart) using Matplotlib. The user interface uses CustomTkinter for better design.

Out-of-Scope (Current Version): Storing data across sessions (currently stored in memory), support for multiple users, and access via the web.

3. Target Users

The main target user is a beginner or student who needs an easy-to-use tool for managing personal finance records. This application is perfect for those looking for a simple system to practice financial tracking and visualization without complicated setups or database needs.

4. High-level Features

>Real-time Balance: Show the net financial balance that updates continuously.

>Visualization: Create a pie chart (using Matplotlib) to illustrate the breakdown of income compared to expenses.
